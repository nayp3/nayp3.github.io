## How do we know if a policy works? 

*At the most basic level, this was the question I homed in on as a Political Science MS student & Applied Community and Economic Development Fellow.*

*My Master's thesis considered a popular piece of legislation at the time -- increased anti-human trafficking protections at the (U.S.) state level. Often, policymakers and advocates who promoted passage of these policies did so, at least in part, with the justification that increased protections were needed for youth who were trafficking victims.*

This project asks whether evidence exists that youth were more likely to be treated as trafficking victims post-policy change. This was proxied through the rate at which youth were arrested for prostitution and controls for changes in socio-demographic characteristics of the state.
